## Chinese isn't displayed right in git bash

**solution**
> right click, select options -> text, set character set to <u>gbk</u> if current character set is <u>utf-8</u>.
> although utf-8 is recommended, some programs still use <u>gbk</u>, in which case <u>utf-8</u> isn't displayed right
> **in most cases, it's true that eight utf-8 or gbk is the right choice**
> **choose the other one when either of them doesn't work**
