non-diverge:
    master: a -> b
    origin/master: a -> b -> c
    after rebase(git rebase origin/master):
    a -> b -> c # local master does not have its own patches (distinct commits)
diverge:
    master: a -> b
    origin/master: a -> c
    after rebase(git rebase origin/master):
    a -> c -> b # apply local master's patches on top of origin/master

rebase puts current branch's commits on top, like replaying these commits on the base of another branch
